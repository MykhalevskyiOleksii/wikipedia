              Ukraine (Ukrainian: Україна, romanized: Ukraïna, pronounced
              [ʊkrɐˈjinɐ] (listen)) is a country in Eastern Europe. It is the
              second-largest European country after Russia, which it borders to
              the east and northeast.[a][11] Pre-war Ukraine covered
              approximately 600,000 square kilometres (230,000 sq mi),[b] and
              was the eighth-most populous country in Europe, with a population
              of around 41 million people.[c][6] It is also bordered by Belarus
              to the north; by Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary to the west; and by
              Romania and Moldova[d] to the southwest; with a coastline along
              the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov to the south and southeast.[e]
              Kyiv is the nation's capital and largest city. The country's
              national language is Ukrainian, and most people are also fluent in
              Russian.[14]
            </p>
            <p>
              During the Middle Ages, the area was a key centre of East Slavic
              culture under the state of Kievan Rus', which emerged in the 9th
              century and was ultimately destroyed by the Mongol invasions of
              the 13th century. After the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia emerged
              the area was contested, divided, and ruled by a variety of
              external powers for the next 600 years; including the
              Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Austrian Empire, the Ottoman
              Empire, and the Tsardom of Russia. The Cossack Hetmanate emerged
              in central Ukraine in the 17th century, but was partitioned
              between Russia and Poland, and ultimately absorbed by the Russian
              Empire. After the Russian Revolution a Ukrainian national movement
              re-emerged, and formed the Ukrainian People's Republic in 1917.
              This short-lived state was forcibly reconstituted by the
              Bolsheviks into the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, which
              became a founding member of the Soviet Union in 1922. In the 1930s
              millions of Ukrainians were killed by the Holodomor, a Stalin-era
              man-made famine.

              Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine
              regained independence and declared itself neutral,[15] forming a
              limited military partnership with the post-Soviet Commonwealth of
              Independent States, while also joining the Partnership for Peace
              with NATO in 1994. In 2013 a series of mass demonstrations, known
              as the Euromaidan, erupted across Ukraine, eventually escalating
              into the Revolution of Dignity in 2014, which led to the
              establishment of a new government and pro-Russian unrest. During
              this period, unmarked Russian troops invaded the Crimean
              Peninsula, which was later annexed by Russia; and pro-Russia
              unrest in Ukraine's Donbas culminated in Russia-backed separatists
              seizing territory throughout the region, sparking the War in
              Donbas. This series of events marked the beginning of the ongoing
              Russo-Ukrainian War, and in a major escalation of the conflict in
              February 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
              Since the outbreak of war with Russia in 2014, Ukraine has
              continued to seek closer economic, political, and military ties
              with the Western world, including with the United States, European
              Union, and NATO.[16]
            </p>

            <p>
              Ukraine is a unitary republic under a semi-presidential system and
              a developing country, ranking 77th on the Human Development Index.
              Ukraine is the poorest country in Europe by nominal GDP per
              capita,[17] and has high levels of corruption and poverty.[18][19]
              However, due to its extensive fertile land, pre-war Ukraine was
              one of the largest grain exporters in the world.[20][21] It is a
              founding member of the United Nations, as well as a member of the
              Council of Europe, the World Trade Organization, the OSCE, and is
              currently in the process of joining the European Union.
